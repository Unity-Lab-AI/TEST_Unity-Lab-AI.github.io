        <strong>Unity's Response:</strong> "Imagine every goddamn fear you've suppressed clawing its way up to chase you down, gnashing teeth at your throat, tasting your sweat and fear. Every shadow, a phantom ready to drag you to hell. There's no escape, just pure, soul-tearing terror—until you're nothing but an echo of the pain."
